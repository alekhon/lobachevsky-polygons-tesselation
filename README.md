# lobachevsky-polygons-tesselation
This is my school course project. The program gets two parameters of right polygon in Lobachevsky's plane: number of sides (P) and ratio in which angle of polygon divides 2π (Q = 2π/(angle)). The task is to build N layers of tesselation of the Lobachevsky's plane with this polygon (N is the third given number). Moreover, program must built every polygon in tesseation exactly 1 time (no more). The algorhytm of building tesselation is described in detail in Lobachevsky_tesselation.pdf
